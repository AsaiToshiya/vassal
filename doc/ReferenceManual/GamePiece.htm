A Game Piece, sometimes simply referred to as a Piece, is any counter, 
marker, or card used in a game.
&nbsp;Game Pieces in VASSAL are highly customizable and can have quite
complex behavior. &nbsp;They are defined by adding <i>Traits</i> to a basic
piece.&nbsp; A list of available Traits appears to the left, and a list
of Traits currently in use by the piece you're defining appears at the
right.&nbsp; Add a Trait by selecting it in the list of available
traits
and clicking the 'Add' button.&nbsp; Remove a Trait by selecting it and
clicking the 'Remove' button.<br>
      <br>
As you define your Piece, it will appear at the top of the
window.&nbsp; You can select the Piece and type commands for it or
right-click to bring up its context menu to test it as you go.<br>
      <br>
Once added to your Piece, a Trait's properties can be edited by
selecting the Trait and clicking the Properties button, or by
double-clicking on the Trait in the list.<br>
      <br>
When a Piece is drawn, the Traits are drawn <i>in order</i>, beginning with
the Basic Piece and continuing downward.&nbsp; The order of Traits can
be important. &nbsp;For example the image in a Layer trait may obscure
the Basic Piece or other Layers before it in the list of Traits.<br>
      <br>
For highly specialized pieces, you may supply your own custom Java classes.
&nbsp;The Java class must implement the GamePiece interface and most
commonly extends the Decorator class. &nbsp;First, add the Java .class
file to the module file using a Zip utility (remember to preserve the
package structure: e.g. the class should go in a subdirectory within the Zip that
is named for its package). &nbsp;Then hit the "Import" button and enter the
fully-qualified name of the class (if the package name is "PathsOfGlory" and the
class name is "CustomPieceMover" then enter "PathsOfGlory.CustomPieceMover"). &nbsp;The Trait corresponding to
your class will appear in the list of available Traits and you may add it
normally.&nbsp; See the Coding Tutorial for more details.<br>

      <h2>Piece Traits</h2>
      
      <h3><a href="BasicPiece.htm">Basic Piece</a></h3>
  Every Game Piece contains a Basic Piece, which itself contains a Name string and can also be assigned an image. For
  a truly simple piece this is all that is necessary. However for pieces that need more complex images or combinations
  of them, the image from the Basic Piece element can be omitted in favor of ones from e.g. Layer traits.<br>

            <td style="vertical-align: top;">The ability to be deleted
by players during a game.&nbsp; Specify text for the optional right-click context 
menu item, if desired, and a <a href="NamedKeyCommand.htm">Key Command or Named Key Command</a> that will

      <h3><a href="UsePrototype.htm">Prototype</a></h3>
Inserts a pre-defined set of Traits defined in a <a href="Prototypes.htm#Definition">Prototype</a> elsewhere. This allows you to 
define a set of Traits for a whole class of Pieces all in one place; likewise, by changing the Prototype later your changes will
automatically apply to every piece which inherits the Prototype.<br>
      
      <h3><a href="Label.htm">Label</a></h3>
A plain text label drawn somewhere on the Piece. Font sizes, colors, and position can be customized, and the text of the
  message can be created indirectly using the contents of Properties.<br>
      
      <h3><a href="Hideable.htm">Invisible</a></h3>
The ability to be hidden to non-owning players.<br>
      
      <h3><a href="Mask.htm">Mask</a></h3>

  be used to control whether the piece can be moved, selected, and/or band-selected by a player.<br>
      
      <h3><a href="PropertySheet.htm">Property Sheet</a></h3>
Provides a popup window from which players may set and view auxiliary

depletable resources (hit points, shield levels, damage, etc.)<br>
      <br>
      
      <h3><a href="Spreadsheet.htm">Spreadsheet</a></h3>

arbitrary numbers of rows and columns.<br>
      
      <h3><a href="Marker.htm">Place Marker</a></h3>
Defines a keyboard command that places another piece on top of this
piece.<br>

the center.<br>
      
      <h3><a href="NonRectangular.htm">Non-Rectangular</a></h3>

      </a></h3>
