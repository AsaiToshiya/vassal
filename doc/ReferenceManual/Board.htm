no
image is used for the board, and the size and color may be specified

      <h2>Sub-Components: Grids</h2>
If a Board contains no grid, then pieces may be placed anywhere on the
board.&nbsp; Pieces dropped on top of one another will stack.&nbsp; If
the board contains a <a href="HexGrid.htm">Hex</a> or <a href="RectangularGrid.htm">Rectangular</a> grid, they
can be configured either to allow pieces anywhere or to have pieces snap to the nearest legal
location on the board as defined by the grid.&nbsp; The grid may be
drawn over the board's image or drawing may be suppressed (for example if the
image already has a grid drawn on it). <a href="IrregularGrid.htm">Irregular</a> grids may be used to define locations 
on maps where the positions are arbitrary; on such grids the option to have pieces snap to
the nearest legal location is selectable. Maps can also be configured to use different grids in different zones through
the use of a <a href="ZonedGrid.htm">Multi-zoned Grid</a>.<br>
