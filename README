The VASSAL Team is happy to announce the release of VASSAL 3.3.1.

* Things may be broken which worked in 3.2.17. If you find a bug introduced
  since 3.2.17, please report it.

* If you save a module in VASSAL 3.3, you will NOT be able to open it
  afterwards with VASSAL 3.2. We recommend keeping a backup copy of
  any pre-3.3 modules you plan to modify in 3.3 until you've verified that
  everything works to your satisfaction.

* Some modules containing custom drawing code may render incorrectly on HiDPI
  displays. If you are the maintainer of such a module, let us know and we
  can advise you about what needs updating for 3.3 in your code. (We are aware
  already that VASL has this problem and are working with its maintainers to
  update it.)

Minimum Requirements

them, so there is no need to install Java separately on those operating
systems.
